# Common Java Runtime Exceptions

This repository contains a simple Java program demonstrating common runtime exceptions that developers may encounter.  The examples include:

*   **ArithmeticException:** Occurs when attempting to divide by zero.
*   **NullPointerException:** Occurs when trying to access a member of a null object reference.
*   **ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException:** Occurs when accessing an array element using an index that is outside the valid range (0 to array.length - 1).

The code provides basic try-catch blocks for exception handling and demonstrates how to catch and handle these errors gracefully.  The goal is to showcase best practices in error management, highlighting the importance of robust exception handling in preventing application crashes.
